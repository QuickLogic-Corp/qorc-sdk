# Host communication example application

The purpose of this host application is to provide a software framework to 
illustrate the use of communicating with a device Quickfeather board to 
run voice recognition applications, and stream audio data from the device
Quickfeather board over to the host Quickfeather board either in raw 16-bit
format or in an Opus encoded bit stream. This example application sends the
received audio data to the PC over USB-serial using base64 encoding. This
base64 encoded data can later be decoded using the [Base64 Audio Decoder]

## Host - Device SPI communcation pin mapping

The table below gives pin mapping for SPI communication between the Host
Quickfeather board and the device Quickfeather board.

Signal Name | S3 Host (Quickfeather header) | S3 Device (Quickfeather header)
----------- | -----------                   | ----------
CLK         |  IO34  (J3.6)       | IO16 (J2.8)
MISO        |  IO36  (J3.4)       | IO17 (J2.7)
MOSI        |  IO38  (J3.5)       | IO19 (J2.6)
CSn         |  IO27  (J2.2)       | IO20 (J2.5)
H2D INT     |  IO11  (J8.6)       | IO12 (J8.7)
D2H INT     |  IO12  (J8.7)       | IO43 (J2.9)
D2H ACK     |  IO13  (J3.8)       | IO11 (J8.6)
H2D ACK     |  IO30  (J3.10)      | IO13 (J3.8)
RSTn        |  IO6   (J8.10)      | RSTn (J3.16)

## Hardware Setup 

Refer [VR raw streaming Hardware Setup] for details on hardware setup

## Building and running the project

1. Use the Makefile provided in qf_vr_apps/qf_host_app/GCC_Project folder and 
   an appropriate ARM GCC toolchain to build the project

2. Use the flash programming procedure to flash the qf_host_app binary to
   a host Quickfeather board.

3. Reset the host Quickfeather board to start running the VR raw streaming 
   application.

## [Base64 Audio Decoder]

Base64 audio data received over the USB-serial terminal can be decoded
using this tool to convert to WAV file format. The resulting WAV file
can be opened using audio tools such as Audacity for further analysis.

```
usage: convb64towav.py [-h] [-i 'file'] [-o 'file']

Info - Converts Base64 encoded file into an Audio WAV file. An input file with
Base64 encoded data must be supplied. Output file names is optional. An output
Audio file is always generated and saved with .wav extension. If no output
file is specified, same name as input file with .wav extension will be used.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i 'file', --input 'file'
                        Input Base64 encoded file
  -o 'file', --output 'file'
                        Output WAV file
```
