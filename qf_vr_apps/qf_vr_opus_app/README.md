# 1-Mic Voice recognition keyword detection example application

The purpose of this application is to provide a software framework to easily
plug-in a 3rd party voice recognition engine for keyword detection applications.
The example application waits for an LPSD event indicating a valid speech signal
(WAIT_ON_LPSD event). The example application then enters Keyword detection
state. Audio data is processed by the VR engine to scan for the keyword.

## Building and running the project

1. Use the Makefile provided in qf_vr_apps/qf_1micvr_app/GCC_Project folder and 
   an appropriate ARM GCC toolchain to build the project

2. Use the flash programming procedure to flash the binary to Quickfeather board.

3. Reset the board to start running the 1-Mic VR application.

## Building using a 3rd party VR engine

The default project does not provide any voice recognition engine, consequently
no keyword detection will be performed. To plug-in the desired 3rd party engine
follow these steps:

1. Implement the functions specified in the qf_vr_apps/qf_1micvr_app/inc/vr_engine_api.h

2. Update the build system in qf_vr_apps/qf_1micvr_app/GCC_Project to add the
   implemented source files.

3. Build the projectand flash the generated application to the Quickfeather board.

4. Use the flash programming procedure to flash the binary to Quickfeather board.

5. Reset the board to start running the 1-Mic VR application.
