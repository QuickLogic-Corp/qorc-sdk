Quickfeather `Simple Streaming Interface <https://sensiml.com/documentation/simple-streaming-specification/introduction.html>`__ AI Application Project
=======================================================================================================================================================

This project performs either data collection or recognition based on the
build mode. Data collection uses `Simple Streaming
Interface <https://sensiml.com/documentation/simple-streaming-specification/introduction.html>`__
to connect and stream sensor data to SensiML's `Data Capture
Lab <https://sensiml.com/products/data-capture-lab/>`__. Adding external
sensors to collect data, analyze and build models is made simple
requiring only a sensor configuration API function and data reading
function API to be supplied for the new sensor. This project provides an
Arduino friendly Wire interface for easily integrating Arduino sensor
code.

Building and running the project for data collection mode:
----------------------------------------------------------

1. Verify that the following macros are set for data collection mode in
   the source file `app_config.h <inc/app_config.h>`__.

::

   #define S3AI_FIRMWARE_IS_COLLECTION  1		/* Enable sensor data collection    */
   #define S3AI_FIRMWARE_IS_RECOGNITION 0		/* Enable knowledgepack recognition */


2. Use the provided `Makefile <GCC_Project/Makefile>`__ and an
   appropriate ARM GCC toolchain to build the project

3. Use the flash programming procedure to flash the binary to
   Quickfeather board.

4. Reset the board to start running the qf_ssi_ai_app application.

5. Use `Data Capture
   Lab <https://sensiml.com/products/data-capture-lab/>`__ to connect,
   stream and capture the sensor data.

Building and running the project for recognition mode:
------------------------------------------------------

1. Verify that the following macros are set for recognition mode in the
the source file `app_config.h <inc/app_config.h>`__.

::

   #define S3AI_FIRMWARE_IS_COLLECTION  0		/* Enable sensor data collection    */
   #define S3AI_FIRMWARE_IS_RECOGNITION 1		/* Enable knowledgepack recognition */

2. Use the provided `Makefile <GCC_Project/Makefile>`__ and an
   appropriate ARM GCC toolchain to build the project

3. Use the flash programming procedure to flash the binary to
   Quickfeather board.

4. Reset the board to start running the qf_ssi_ai_app application.

5. Connect a UART to the Quickfeather board. Open a terminal
   application, set its baud to 4608000 bps to get the recognition
   results from the running application.

For details on data collection, building an AI model, and recognition
please refer to `SensiML Getting
Started <https://sensiml.com/documentation/guides/getting-started/index.html>`__

Building and running the project for saving data to an SD card:
----------------------------------------------------------

Saving sensor data and recognition results to a QLSM file format is supported
in this version. The QLSM file can later be imported into the `Data Capture
Lab <https://sensiml.com/products/data-capture-lab/>`__

Quickfeather does not have a built-in SD card. Use an Adalogger featherwing
connected to the Quickfeather to use the sensor data saving to SD card feature.

File system library selection
~~~~~~~~~~

Select the desired filesystem library to use by updating the following macros 
in the source file `Fw_global_config.h <inc/Fw_global_config.h>`__. FatFs is
the default and recommended library to use with qorc-sdk

::

    /* The following macros select the filesystem used in the QLFS Library */
    /* Select the filesystem API to use */
    #define USE_FREERTOS_FAT         0  ///< Set this to 1 to use FreeRTOS FAT filesystem (Merced default)
    #define USE_FATFS                1  ///< Set this to 1 to use FATFs filesystem

File size selection
~~~~~~~~~~~

The amount of data collected and saved to the SD card can quickly grow in size 
based on the number of channels being recorded and the sensor data sample rate
selections. Assigning a positive value to the following macro in the source file
`Fw_global_config.h <inc/Fw_global_config.h>`__ will cause the data save task
to use a new file each time the size reaches the limit specified in this macro.

::

    /* Select the maximum file size for storing the sensor data */
    #define RIFF_FILE_SIZE_MAX   (1024*4*25)  // 100KB

Filename conventions
~~~~~~~~~~~

A timestamp or a sequential counter may be used as suffix to the auto generated
filenames where the sensor data will be stored. Enable the desired macro in the 
source file `Fw_global_config.h <inc/Fw_global_config.h>`__.

::

    // Select one of the filenaming generation when RIFF_FILE_SIZE_MAX is defined
    #define RIFF_AUTO_SEQUENCE_FILENAMES        (0)  // Set to 1 to use sequential count appended to filename
    #define RIFF_TIMESTAMP_SEQUENCE_FILENAMES   (1)  // Set to 1 to use timestamp appended to filename
    #define USE_DCL_FILENAME_ONLY               (0)


1. Verify that the following macros is set for saving data to SD card 

To save recognition results to the SD card, enable the macro S3AI_FIRMWARE_DATASAVE in 
in the source file `app_config.h <inc/acpp_config.h>`__.

::

    #define S3AI_FIRMWARE_LIVESTREAM 0   		/* Enable livestream via SSI Interface  (supports only sensor or recogntion not both)  */
    #define S3AI_FIRMWARE_DATASAVE 1 			/* Enable SD card for collection        (supports sensor and recogntion not both)      */


2. Use the provided `Makefile <GCC_Project/Makefile>`__ and an
   appropriate ARM GCC toolchain to build the project

3. Use the flash programming procedure to flash the binary to
   Quickfeather board.

4. Reset the board to start running the qf_ssi_ai_app application.

5. Connect a UART to the Quickfeather board. Open a terminal
   application, set its baud to 4608000 bps to start saving the
   sensor data to the SD card.

Adding a sensor
---------------

The default project uses the onboard Accelerometer sensor for data
collection. This section provides basic guideline on adding a new sensor
to the project for data collection. Sensor data acquisition and
processing or transfer to an external application such as `Data Capture
Lab <https://sensiml.com/products/data-capture-lab/>`__ uses `datablock
manager <../../qf_vr_apps#datablock-manager>`__
(qorc-sdk/Libraries/DatablockManager) and `datablock
processor <../../qf_vr_apps#datablock-processor>`__
(qorc-sdk/Tasks/DatablockProcessor) for acquiring samples and processing
these acquired samples. Qorc-sdk uses `Simple Streaming
Interface <https://sensiml.com/documentation/simple-streaming-specification/introduction.html>`__
protocol to send the acquired sensor data over to the [DataCaptureLab]

FreeRTOS software timer is used to trigger a timer event to read 1
sample from the sensor and fill the datablock. When enough samples are
collected (determined by the sensor sample rate, and latency), the
datablock is processed and the samples are sent over the UART using the
`Simple Streaming
Interface <https://sensiml.com/documentation/simple-streaming-specification/introduction.html>`__.

The `Wire interface <inc/Wire.h>`__ may be used to provide the requrired configuration
and sample acquisition member functions to configure and read data from
the new sensor.

Configure the sensor
--------------------

To add a new sensor start with the sensor_ssss.h and sensor_ssss.c
source files. Sensor sampling rate and number of channels are specified
in the macros defined in the header file sensor_ssss.h. Configuring and
reading from the sensor requires atleast 3 member functions:

-  begin() this member function initializes and configures the new
   sensor.
-  set_sample_rate() this member function sets the desired sample rate
   for this sensor
-  read() reads 1 sample of data from this sensor. To make synchronizing
   and fusing multiple sensor data easier, this function simply retries
   the current sample available in the sensor and returns the value.

.. _sensor_ssssh:

sensor_ssss.h
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Modify the header file sensor_ssss.h and update the following macros

-  SENSOR_SSSS_SAMPLE_RATE to specify the desired sensor sampling rate
-  SENSOR_SSSS_CHANNELS_PER_SAMPLE to specify the desired number of
   channels for the new sensor
-  SENSOR_SSSS_LATENCY default latency is set to 20ms. This value
   determines how often the samples are processed and transmitted to the
   DCL (`Data Capture
   Lab <https://sensiml.com/products/data-capture-lab/>`__). The default
   value may be left as is.

The above macros determine the number of samples held in one datablock.
These datablocks are held in the array sensor_ssss_data_blocks[].

.. _sensor_ssssc:

sensor_ssss.c
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Update the function sensor_ssss_configure() to initialize and setup
   the sensor configuration. The example code uses the following code
   snippet to configure the onboard accelerometer sensor.

   ::

      MC3635  qorc_ssi_accel;

   ::

      qorc_ssi_accel.begin();
      qorc_ssi_accel.set_sample_rate(sensor_ssss_config.rate_hz);
      qorc_ssi_accel.set_mode(MC3635_MODE_CWAKE);

Output data description
-----------------------

Update the string value definition of json_string_sensor_config in
sensor_ssss.cpp for the new sensor added to this project. The example
project which uses 3-channel onboard accelerometer is described using
the following string:

::

       {
          sample_rate:100,
          samples_per_packet:6,
          column_location:{
             AccelerometerX:0,
             AccelerometerY:1,
             AccelerometerZ:2
          }
       }

Refer the SensiML `Data Capture
Lab <https://sensiml.com/products/data-capture-lab/>`__ for details

Acquring and processing sensor samples
--------------------------------------

Based on the sensor sample rate, a FreeRTOS soft timer triggers
requesting 1 sensor sample to be filled-in the datablock.

.. _sensor_ssssc-1:

sensor_ssss.c
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Update the function sensor_ssss_acquisition_buffer_ready to read 1
   sample (16-bits per channel) into the current datablock. This
   function returns 1 if datablock is ready for processing, returns 0
   otherwise.

   The example code uses the following code snippet to configure the
   onboard accelerometer sensor.

.. code:: c++

       xyz_t accel_data = qorc_ssi_accel.read();  /* Read accelerometer data from MC3635 */
       
       /* Fill this accelerometer data into the current data block */
       int16_t *p_accel_data = (int16_t *)p_dest;
       
       *p_accel_data++ = accel_data.x;
       *p_accel_data++ = accel_data.y;
       *p_accel_data++ = accel_data.z;
       
       p_dest += 6; // advance datablock pointer to retrieve and store next sensor data

Capturing the sensor samples
----------------------------

-  Sensor samples are sent using the `Simple Streaming
   Interface <https://sensiml.com/documentation/simple-streaming-specification/introduction.html>`__.
   A 16-bit little-endian data format is used for sending each channel's
   sample data. Quickfeather uses either an S3 UART or the USB serial to
   transmit these data. Sensor samples may be captured using `Data
   Capture Lab <https://sensiml.com/products/data-capture-lab/>`__

Accelerometer sensor example
----------------------------

An example accelerometer (mCube's MC3635) sensor available onboard is
provided as part of this application. The MC3635 class interface to
configure and read data from the sensor is available in the source files
mc3635_wire.cpp and mc3635_wire.h. The sensor configuration function
sensor_ssss_configure() uses the begin() function of the class MC3635 to
configure and set up the accelerometer for acquiring samples
approximately at the chosen sampling rate (SENSOR_SSSS_SAMPLE_RATE).

To read samples the configured sampling rate, sensor data read is
performed when the FreeRTOS soft timer triggers the function
sensor_ssss_acquisition_buffer_ready(). The read() member function is
used to read three 16-bit samples and fill-in the current data block.
When 20ms (= SENSOR_SSSS_LATENCY) samples are filled in the data block,
these samples are processed by the function
sensor_ssss_livestream_data_processor() to send these samples over UART
using `Simple Streaming
Interface <https://sensiml.com/documentation/simple-streaming-specification/introduction.html>`__.
