qf_fpgauart_app
===============

Purpose
-------

The purpose of this app is to provide a simple example code to show usage of 
FPGA UART APIs. This application loads the FPGA UART gateware, starts the
FPGA clocks and runs a CLI (Command Line Interface) that allows the user to
- send a string of characters to the FPGA UART terminal
- receive specified length of bytes from the FPGA UART terminal
- run a speed test

Setup
-----

Build the project using the Makefile located in the folder
qorc-sdk/qf_apps/qf_fpgauart_app. Load the binary to the Quickfeather board.
Connect one UART cable to the Quickfeather board HEADER_TX and HEADER_RX headers
and another UART cable to the FPGA UART0 configured pins. The table below gives
the default assignment. These can be changed by updating the quickfeather.pcf
file in the FPGA UART gateware project. The CLI (command line interface) attached
to the first UART terminal may be used to send and receive data from the FPGA UART0
terminal. 
Connect a third UART cable to FPGA UART1 configured pins. The CLI attached to 
the first UART terminal may be used to send and receive data from the FPGA UART1
terminal.

Name      | Quickfeather pad# | Quickfeather IO# | Quickfeather Header |
--------  | ------------      | ---------------- | ------------------- |
UART0 Tx  |   2               | IO_2             |  J3.7               |
UART0 Rx  |   3               | IO_3             |  J2.10              |
UART1 Tx  |   4               | IO_4             |  J8.7               |
UART1 Rx  |   5               | IO_5             |  J8.9               |
GND       |   10              | IO_10            |  J8.8               |

CLI UART0/UART1 Commands
---------

The following commands are available for sending and receiving data from the 
FPGA UART terminals.

```
[0] > help
help-path: (top)
readid         - Get FPGA device-id
diag           - QuickFeather diagnostic commands
uart0          - QuickFeather FPGA-UART0 commands
uart1          - QuickFeather FPGA-UART1 commands
exit           - exit/leave menu

help-end:
```

To send data to FPGA UART0, issue the following command:
```
[0] > uart0 send HelloWorld!
```

The string HelloWorld! would appear on the terminal application connected FPGA UART0
configured pins.

Similarly to receive data from FPGA UART0, issue the following commnad:
```
[0] > uart0 recv 5
```

The CLI will wait for data to be input on the FPGA UART0 terminal. Type in 5 characters
on the FPGA UART0 terminal. These characters will then be echoed on the CLI terminal.
