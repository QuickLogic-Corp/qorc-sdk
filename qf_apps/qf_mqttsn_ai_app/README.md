Quickfeather AI Application Project
=================================

This demo project performs SensiML data collection and recognition tasks 
for the Quickfeather platform using QORC-SDK.
(Refer: https://github.com/QuickLogic-Corp/qorc-sdk)

An AD7476 Analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is added to this project. The project
uses ADC FPGA IP design from [s3-gateware]. Communication interface for MQTT-SN
messages uses the ASSP UART interface.

Audio data capture and inference feature added to this project. To enable live-streaming
1-channel audio data captured at @16kHz sampling rate, 921600bps baudrate is used 
for the ASSP UART interface.

Building and running the project:
---------------------
The project supports either collection or recognition modes.
Select the desired mode by updating the macro S3AI_FIRMWARE_MODE in 
Fw_global_config.h.

1. Use the provided Makefile in qf_mqttsn_ai_app/GCC_Project folder
and appropriate ARM GCC toolchain to build the project

2. Use the flash programming procedure to flash the binary to Quickfeather board.

3. Reset the board to start running the AI application.

For data collection, building an AI model, and recognition 
please refer to [SensiML QF] and [SensiML Getting Started]

Using with an AD7476 ADC module
------------

Connect a [PmodAD1] module to the quickfeather using the following pinout

| PmodAD1 module  | Quickfeather |
| --------------- | ------------ |
| CS              | J8.5         |
| D0              | J8.9         |
| CLK             | J8.11        |
| GND             | J8.13        |
| Vcc             | J8.15        |

Connect desired sensor to the A0 pin on the PmodAD1 module.

Reset the Quickfeather board to start running the AI application.
Refer [SensiML QF] to collect data or get inferences from this connected sensor.

MQTT-SN over USB-serial Notes
------------

The MQTT-SN SensiML AI application may be configured to use FPGA USB-serial IP to send and receive message over
USB-serial cable provided this FPGA IP is not used for other purposes such as ADC AD7476 IP used for ADC sensor. 
The USB transmit FIFO will hold the outgoing data bytes until a host terminal application starts draining this data. According as the MQTT-SN protocol, the application attempts
to send CONNECT messages at regular intervals until it receives a response for these messages. 
To avoid queueing up multiple CONNECT messages in the transmit FIFO which may cause the USB 
transmit function to enter busy-wait state when the FIFO fills-up, this application sends CONNECT
messages only if the FIFO is empty.
